    <h2>A little about me.</h2>
    <div id="aboutPage">
      <div class="sideText">
        <p>Hey there. I'm Nathan Bray, a 22-year-old from Portishead who studies an Interactive Media MSc at York University and is passionate about all things tech. As a child, I watched my older brothers play games and soon became fascinated by the design and development of games. I received my first laptop when I was eight years old. With it, I started creating levels for others to enjoy. This helped me express my creativity through playing games like Roblox and Minecraft.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My ideas evolved into simple digital experiences such as 2D platformers and small 3D explorable spaces as I experimented with more professional tools such as Unity and Blender. My skills and knowledge of these tools rapidly expanded throughout sixth form and university. I constantly tried to improve myself and my knowledge to create more complex digital experiences for my friends. As well as watching behind-the-scenes development videos, I also enjoyed learning more about how some of my favorite games were created and what content might not have made it to the final product.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I’m now very confident in turning simple ideas into full gameplay experiences but I’m still looking for ways to push my skills further. Recently I’ve been attending GameJams with friends run by the Game Development society here at York as a way to see what we’re able to create under a strict time frame which has been a fun way to collaborate and explore new ideas that I might not explore if I was working alone.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In addition to game development, I enjoy traveling, photography, and table tennis. Recently I've been using the holidays to travel abroad with friends to new places, which has been amazing. In my free time, I also study German and Spanish, and try out new cooking recipes to find inspiration and find favorites.</p>
