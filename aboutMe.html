        <p>Hey there, I'm Nathan Bray, a 24-year-old from Portishead. I hold an Interactive Media BSc from York University and have just completed an MSc by resarch in it too. I have a strong passion for technology. Since childhood, I've been captivated by game design and development, initially sparked by watching my older brothers play games.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My journey began at the age of eight when I received my first laptop, diving into creating levels for games like Roblox and Minecraft. Over time, I transitioned to more professional tools like Unity and Blender, honing my skills in 2D platformers and 3D spaces. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Throughout sixth form and university, I continuously expanded my knowledge, seeking to create more intricate digital experiences for friends. I avidly consume behind-the-scenes development content and explore the creation processes of my favorite games. I'm adept at transforming simple ideas into complete gameplay experiences, yet I'm always eager to enhance my skills further.</p>
