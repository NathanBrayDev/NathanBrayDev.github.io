      <button onclick="ToggleVisibility('hide1')" class="toggleTextButton">Context</button>
      <p class="projectText hide1">This project was a partnership with XR-Stories with the main goal to produce a immersive storytelling app that addresses key climate change topics with me originally working on it for an internship and staying on until it was completed and shown as part of an exhibition in York.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="projectText hide1">For this project I worked alongside the talented professionals within Field Studios with my main responsibility being to program all the functionality within the app. In the end we created a webapp that users could access on their phone and then go through a non-linear narrative with their decisions affecting the characters they create. Upon completion their character would then be sent to "The Gyre", which showed a collection of all the characters that had been created by all the users at the exhibition.</p>

      <button onclick="ToggleVisibility('hide2')" class="toggleTextButton">Skills used</button>
      <ol class="projectText hide2">
        <li>Unity</li>
        <li>C#</li>
        <li>PHP</li>
        <li>JSON</li>
        <li>Team working</li>
        <li>Communication</li>
        <li>Time management</li>
      </ol>


      <button onclick="ToggleVisibility('hide3')" class="toggleTextButton">Skills developed</button>
      <p class="projectText hide3">This was my first time working on a project for a company and I knew I really wanted to push myself out of my comfort zone to get the most out of it. Going into this project I was unsure how to use Unity's networking, a PHP file or how to create a fluid chat system but through pushing myself to learn these things I've been able to expand my skills and create something I'm really proud of.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="projectText hide3">Thanks to this project I also learned how much I enjoy working within an office in a team. Being able to bounce ideas off of each other is great and being able to see them work in person is inspiring.</p>
      <button onclick="ToggleVisibility('hide4')" class="toggleTextButton">Conclusion</button>
        <p class="projectText hide4">I'm really grateful for the opportunity that both XR Stories and Field Studios gave me and it allowed me to learn so many more techniques that I'll be able to use in both professional and personal projects. It was also an amazing experience seeing people from the public try out the app for the first time and see their characters be added to the Gyre throughout the exhibition</p>
